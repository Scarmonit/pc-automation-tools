## Remediation Strategy

1. **Identify all hardcoded credentials and secrets**
2. **Create environment variables or secure vault storage**
3. **Replace hardcoded values with variable references**
4. **Update deployment configuration**
5. **Test with new secure configuration**
6. **Add secrets to .gitignore if not already present**
