## Description

All docker security related issues requiring remediation

‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY** - These issues should be resolved promptly to improve security and code quality.

## Issues Summary

| ID | Description | File | Line | Status |
|-----|-------------|------|------|--------|
| SEC-MEDIUM-009 | Container may run as root user... | docker-compose.development.yml` | N/A | open |
| SEC-MEDIUM-010 | Container may run as root user... | docker-compose.monitoring.yml` | N/A | open |
| SEC-MEDIUM-011 | Container may run as root user... | docker-compose.vllm.yml` | N/A | open |
| SEC-MEDIUM-012 | Container may run as root user... | docker-compose.yml` | N/A | open |


## Remediation Strategy

1. **Review all Docker Compose files**
2. **Add non-root user configurations**
3. **Implement security contexts and capabilities**
4. **Configure network isolation**
5. **Test container functionality with security settings**
6. **Update documentation for secure deployment**

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation
- [ ] Review all issues in this category
- [ ] Identify files requiring changes
- [ ] Backup affected files
- [ ] Set up testing environment

### Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] Address high-impact issues first
- [ ] Apply remediation changes systematically
- [ ] Test changes incrementally
- [ ] Document changes made

### Phase 3: Validation
- [ ] Run security/quality checks
- [ ] Verify no new issues introduced
- [ ] Update issue status tracking
- [ ] Review with team

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All containers run as non-root users
- [ ] Proper security contexts configured
- [ ] Network isolation implemented where appropriate
- [ ] No unnecessary capabilities granted
- [ ] Security scan passes for container configurations

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Level: üü° HIGH

### Potential Impact
Container escape vulnerabilities, privilege escalation, security compliance failures

### Mitigation Strategy
Implement systematic remediation following the implementation plan. Test thoroughly and maintain secure practices.
