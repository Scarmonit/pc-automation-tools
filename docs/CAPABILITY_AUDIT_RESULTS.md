## 🎯 Key Findings

### ✅ Confirmed Functional Capabilities

1. **Parallel Execution**: Working with proven efficiency gains
2. **Distributed Processing**: Multiple nodes processing tasks simultaneously
3. **Cross-Target Analysis**: Correlating threats across different targets
4. **Real-Time Aggregation**: Live result compilation from all agents
5. **Load Balancing**: Even distribution of work across resources
6. **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful error handling and retry mechanisms

### ⚠️ Areas for Optimization

1. **Pattern Detection**: While functional with 51 patterns available, the test detection rate was low. This may be due to:
   - Test content not containing enough pattern matches
   - Pattern sensitivity settings
   - False positive filtering being too aggressive
