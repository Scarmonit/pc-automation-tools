## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Asynchronous Architecture
```python

    for agent in self.agents.values():
        if agent.agent_type == task.agent_type:
            async_tasks.append(agent.execute_task(task))

# Execute all tasks in parallel
completed_tasks = await asyncio.gather(*async_tasks)
```

### Load Balancing Algorithm
```python
# Find least loaded node for task distribution
least_loaded_node = min(node_list, key=lambda n: n.current_load)
task.assigned_node = least_loaded_node.node_id
least_loaded_node.current_load += 1
```

### Cross-Target Threat Correlation
```python
# Identify threats appearing across multiple targets
for pattern, occurrences in threat_patterns.items():
    unique_targets = set(o["target"] for o in occurrences)
    if len(unique_targets) > 1:
        cross_target_threats.append({
            "pattern": pattern,
            "affected_targets": list(unique_targets)
        })
